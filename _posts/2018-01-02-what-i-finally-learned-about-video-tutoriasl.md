They're Good! very good -BUT sitting back with your favorite mug and dedicating an entire evening to watching tutorials won't make you a more fluent programmer !

I have been a member of just about every programming tutorial platform out there- just to give you an idea:
* Codeschool - (entertaining - but they serve you the code on a silver platter)
* TreeHouse - (very pleasant - but code is served to you on golden platter)
* Thinkful - (Stay far away)
* eDX (these tutorials and exercises are actually VERY good)
* Udacity (currently - jury is out)
* Coursera (these tutorials and exercises are actually VERY good as well)
* Codecademy (easy -- a bit too easy - but great Mile high view of a language)
* Udemy (you'll catch an idea of what's going on  - but that's pretty much it)
* etc...

Again the above just represents my own experience with these platforms and I am 100% sure someone who is reading this is ready to put down the nachos and go to war with me (chillax, just my sentiments, you are welcomed to hang on to your own!)

But the truth has becoming very clear to me, these platforms are meant to simply give you a taste for what you are in for and THAT'S THAT  - the real learning begins when you actually say "Ok i've read/watched 10 hours of X - now i'm going to take what i learned from X, the links to docs, the tips etc. and build my own application employing what i've learned!" that's it! There is no easy two steps to it.  Learning to program isn't easy, it isn't entertaining nor pleasant.  It's disturbing, annoying, and absolutely hard as S@#%t!

So of course you must be asking why do we do it?! why spend 4 hours looking for a missing comma, or 3 days questioning your very existance?  The answer is simple -The breakthrough is well worth it! I love it!  -makes no sense right? -right and nor should any learning platform - you've got to go through the pain of learning by doing -- You can't become a good mechanic by watching and reading books on engines and radiators - NOPE the actual learning begins when get your hands dirty --Its the very same with learning to code. (Hmm I should write that down)

So what's all this about?  well it's this.  This year i plan to have 25 practical and useful applications completed.  Useful in the sense that it actually aims to solve a real problem people are having  -  I've got to get my hands dirty - The videos are ok -- But getting my hands dirty, being frustrated and annoyed while building is where the breakthroughs happen - see you there!

ps

I'm going to get a spell checker plugin - bear with me
